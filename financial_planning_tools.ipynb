    "\n",
    "    - `columns`: Set this parameter equal to a Python list with a single value called `amount`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `index`: Set this parameter equal to a Python list with the values of `crypto` and `stock/bond`.\n",

    "3. Use the `savings_df` DataFrame to plot a pie chart that visualizes the composition of the member’s portfolio. The y-axis of the pie chart uses `amount`. Be sure to add a title.\n",
